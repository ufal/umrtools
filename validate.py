    """
    `inp` a file-like object yielding lines as unicode
    `args` are needed for choosing the tests

    This function does elementary checking of the input and yields one
    sentence at a time from the input stream.

    This function is a generator. The caller can call it in a 'for x in ...'
    loop. In each iteration of the caller's loop, the generator will generate
    the next sentence, that is, it will read the next sentence from the input
    stream. (Technically, the function returns an object, and the object will
    then read the sentences within the caller's loop.)

    A sentence in a UMR file consists of:
    - Comment lines. Their first character is '#'. Some of them may contain
      machine-readable metadata. Others can be ignored.
      (Note: With the option --allow-inline-comments, comments can occur also
      on other lines. Everything from the # character to the end of the line
      will then be ignored, the part before the # character is a line of
      another type.)
    - Empty lines. An empty line separates two annotation blocks of the same
      sentence (e.g., document level graph from sentence level graph). Two empty
      lines separate sentences. Empty lines must not occur inside annotation
      blocks, e.g., inside the sentence level graph.
    - Interlinear glossing lines. The line starts with a header that specifies
      type of the contents on the line, then there are space-separated words
      or morphs or their glosses (possible in multiple languages).
    - Graph lines (either sentence level graph, or document level annotation).
      They may start with whitespace (' ', "\t") and they typically do, except
      for the first line of the graph. Whitespace can be ignored (but we may
      want to report trailing whitespace, just to tidy up). After whitespace,
      there must be either the opening bracket ('(') or a colon (':'). One or
      more closing brackets may occur at the end of the line; they are never
      put on a line of their own.
    - Every opening bracket must be immediately followed by a variable id (e.g.,
      's1p'), a slash ('/'), and a concept string.
    - Every colon must be immediately followed by a relation/attribute label,
      then whitespace and either an atomic value, or a string in double quotes,
      or the opening bracket of a child node.
    - The alignment block has its own type of lines. It starts with a variable
      id of a concept node in the sentence graph, followed by a colon and
      a space, followed by an integer range (e.g. '2-2'). These are 1-based
      indices of tokens that represent the concept node on the surface. '0-0'
      means that the concept is not overtly represented on the surface.
